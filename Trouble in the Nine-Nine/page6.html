      <p>While searching the precinct for the source of the mysterious noises, Jake and Charles determine that the sounds are coming from the file room. They carefully enter the file room and find Gina inside!</p><p>It turns out, Gina was extremely sick and ran out of medicine in her apartment so she decided to stay with her grandmother to take care of her. However, she disliked staying with her grandmother as it was too loud so she decided to stay in the file room of the 99 precinct for peace while she recovers.</p>
